# CLI-Timer

The CLI-Timer is a program that takes a number of user defined time blocks and counts down. A number of sounds are played upon commencment of the timer and the end of each time block to differenciate each milestone in the timer. This is done using Object-Oriented principles and libraries that allow for sound and datetime to count down to the specified time.
